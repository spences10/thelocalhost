As a developer you spend a lot of time in the terminal so it's
important to be happy and as productive as possible whilst you're in
there.

This is why I'm a big fan of the Fish Shell in particular. The Fish
Shell is a user friendly shell with really handy features like
auto-suggestions and tab completions that come preconfigured, no need
to install additional plugins and mess around with config files.
That's not to say Fish Shell isn't configurable, there are plugins
available.

## Navigation

Ok, let's look at a typical navigation example in bash, if you want to
change directory, you have to enter `cd` followed by the directory
name. In Fish you only need to type out the directory name.

Similarly if you want to go back a directory in bash, you need to
start with `cd` in Fish it's just a case of `../`.

```bash
# change directories in bash
cd Downloads
cd ../
# change directories in fish
Downloads/
../
```

## Auto-suggestions

Fish will suggest both directories and commands as you type away, you
will see suggestions in grey which you can tab onto to select.

If you want to go through you last `yarn` (or `npm`) commands, rather
than (like in bash) arrow through all you previously entered commands
(I know you can use `Ctr+r` in bash) or print out the history and look
at that.

In Fish if you start typing out your command, let's say `yarn` you can
then arrow through all commands that have included `yarn` it doesn't
even have to be the beginning of the command, if you have used a
package and want to know what else you installed with it at the time
you can use the package name then arrow though all command with that
keyword in there.

## Tab Completions

## Aliases

Aliases are where you're too lazy to keep typing in the full command
again and again so you make a shorter one, for me I have aliased `git`
to `g` in Fish, (I know, but that extra two characters over time is a
lot).

Aliases in shells like bash and zsh you need to open your config file
and find a appropriate place to add you alias. In

## Install Fish shell

Linux and Windows Subsystem Linux:

```bash
sudo apt -y install fish
```

macOS:

```bash
brew install fish
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
sudo bash -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/fish >> /etc/shells'
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```

## Oh My Fish (OMF)

[Oh My Fish] is touted as the Fishshell Framework but all I have used
it for is the extensive themes available, once you have installed OMF
you can list them out in the terminal with: `omf theme`

There's previews available on the [OMF Themes Markdown doc].

To install OMF, in the terminal enter the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
```

An [extensive list] of packages available too

```bash
omf describe brew
```
